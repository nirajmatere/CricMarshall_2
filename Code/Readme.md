# RAG Approach

### embeddings of important details of match-info
### embedding of input query
### find the 3 most similar embeddings
### find the scorecard of the match corrosponding to the similar embeddings using file name
### embedding of each line of scorecard.
### find top 3 most similar embeddings to the input query embedding
### give the top 3 scorecard lines to the LLM along with question and system prompt.
### get answer
### Judge: Answer is correct? or hallucinated?
### next step?
